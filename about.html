      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hello, this is your webmaster speaking. Call me Coby Cat, or Fox Simile. Any resemblance to a certain
        popular rodent is <a href="portfolio/oc/index.html">purely intentional</a>! My neighborhood in the global
        village is Europe (in a house called Belgium), but I try to keep a cosmopolitan outlook. My interests are pretty
        broad, but in the context of this site they often circle around pop and consumer culture.</p>
      <h2>ðŸ”„ Coming Full Circle</h2>
      <p>I started creating websites during my childhood, using Freewebs for hosting. Sadly, those early sites are long
        gone (<a href="aboutpages/essays/cominghome.html">and the internet culture that they belonged to</a></a>),
        but here on Neocities, Iâ€™ve come full circle. Though you <a href="aboutpages/essays/butwhy.html">might be
          wondering why
          I even bother</a>, haha.</p>
      <h2>ðŸŽ­ Nostalgia & Reinvention</h2>
      <p>Iâ€™m deeply nostalgic, but I also believe in <q>vintage aesthetics, not vintage values</q>. My life has been a
        bit of a rollercoasterâ€”at some point, I moved away from the things that once brought me joy, searching for
        deeper meaning. Unfortunately, the paths I followed led to burnout, and I realized the real treasure had been
        right where I left it. I try soothe my woes in the sweet nectar of nostalgia, yet I also find renewed
        inspiration in the (perhaps naÃ¯ve) optimism that marked my formative years.</p>
      <p>Rekindling my childhood interests helped me find balance again. But Iâ€™m not interested in merely preserving the
        pastâ€”I want to <strong>transform it creatively</strong>. I curate and cherry pick with much gusto, but I also
        want to <em>create!</em>.</p>
      <h2>ðŸ’ª Handcrafted website</h2>
      <p>My website is largely made by hand, barring a little Python script that aides me with constructing my blog
        feeds. The
        visual design tries to emulate something you'd see around the year 2007, taking cues from <a
          href="https://www.theskinsfactory.com/uiux-design-blog/a-look-back-on-our-design-work-for-the-walt-disney-company">The
          Skins Factory's designs for Disney</a> for example. But unlike the way it was done back then, I try to do it
        primarily with modern day <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, as a challenge.</p>
      <p>The wordmark in my sidebar was made with <a href="https://www.blender.org/" class="external">Blender</a>, while
        vector-based illustrations are made with <a href="https://inkscape.org/" class="external">Inkscape</a>,</p>
