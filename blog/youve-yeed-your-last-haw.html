<p>Germany really loved westerns, as you may know. That's a bit outside of the scope of my website for now, though maybe I'll get to it someday. Still, Belgium also had a strong fondness for the genre, as you can see in my article about <a href="../misc-articles/western/villages.html">Cowboy villages</a>. You know, I actually got some research help from my friends over at the 32-bit CafÃ©. Even deeply personal websites like mine can be a team effort! ðŸ¤ </p>
<p>In other site news, I've got rid of some external frameworks I used to imitate GUIs in some obscure corners of my websites. This should make my site leaner in case you venture that deeply.</p>
<p>I've been listening to a bunch of DungeonSynth albums, way too many to all list them out. Gonna opt to highlight a recent compilation then: <cite><a href="https://dungeonsynthcompilation.bandcamp.com/album/c14-the-black-keep">C14: The Black Keep</a></cite>, which is conceptualized as a sort of oldschool D&D adventure.</p>
<p><cite><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1448780/Jewel_Match_Origins__Palais_Imperial_Collectors_Edition/">Jewel Match Origins: Palais Imperial</a></cite> is a game I've been enjoying lately. I like a good themed Match 3 game, but I especially like that the jewels are rendered in a realistic fashion. Many mobile Match 3 games I've played have the most gorgeous artwork, just to resort to clashing cartoony gems regardless.</p>
